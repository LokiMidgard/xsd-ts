# xsd-ts

A tool that generates a parser and type definitions from xsd for typescript.

## Remarks

I primary develop it for a project where I have an xml schema I need to parse.
It can currently not handle every xsd that is out there, and probably will
never do. XSDs can get very complex.

If it works for you feel free to use it. If there are features currently not
supported, You can open an issue, but I will probably not fix it unless it can
be done in a few minutes.

Feel free to fork and change it so it will fit your XSD. I'm also happy for pull
requests as long my XSD can still be consumed ;)
